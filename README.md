## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Tristan and I'm a Data/AI Engineer from France <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/c3/Flag_of_France.svg" width="20" /> , interested in Python/SQL & Data Science.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on one project:   
      - A Machine Learning project to predict the NBA MVP using the statistics of the players during regular season.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m also currently learning Python libraries to do Machine Learning and associated tools for AI Engineering (Docker, Airflow, Streamlit, Azure, ...)
